we need a file table in proc.c
what goes into the structs that go into the file table (file properties)
index 1 of file table represents stdout. (0 in, 2 err)


struct vnode in vnode.h (Abstract low-level file, basis for the structs that will go in our file table)

Find the first process that gets run and initializes stout stin stderr

"con:" refers to the console "file" <--- Dis shit gonna save our ass

take a look at how init process is launched (shameless copypasta territory)

look at loadelf load_segment

address space is found in the proc struct, look at proc_getas(), also global variable curproc
