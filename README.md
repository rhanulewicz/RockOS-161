An instructional operating system based on Harvard's OS/161 with our own custom from-scratch implementations of:
  * Synchronization (locks, condition variables, reader-writer locks)
  * File system call interface (open, close, read, write, getpid, dup2)
  * User process support (fork, execv, sbrk)
  * Fully-featured virtual memory subsystem with TLB management and LRU swapping.

For setup, see: https://ops-class.org/asst/setup/

Passes all test161 test suites with a perfect score. Unfortunately the leaderboards are no longer online.
